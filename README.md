# Start page

Creates a start page where you can quickly access up to 6 websites, and switch between them.
You can also add links that open in a new window.

This project is built using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Live demo: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6945265/start/app/index.html](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6945265/start/app/index.html).

## Usage

1. Upload the contents to where you want them on your machine, or upload to a web server.
2. Access the file /app/index.html, make sure you're always using http://, because file:// will not work.
